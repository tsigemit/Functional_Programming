Our project will consist in an implementation of the game Tetris based on the [Introduction to functional programming assignment text](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2017/course/TDA555/lab3.html).

If time allows it, we are willing to actually develop a variant of the game, where the blocks are github avatar-shaped and behave like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Tq0vfiLzn8c). Note that we had no part in the making of the video, and it just served as a source of inspiration.
